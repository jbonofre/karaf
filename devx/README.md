# Apache Karaf DevX

Karaf DevX focus on simplifying and improving the developer experience on Apache Karaf.

The purpose is to address the following:

* the developer should not deal with "bundle headers" anymore. The developer just writes a regular jar file and devX is dealing with the rest.
* no need to write a feature XML or JSON anymore. Most of the time, the features XML is just a wrapper for the bundle and required dependencies.
* easy packaging and Karaf distribution. Today, creating a custom distribution embedding an application is not straight forward. DevX simplify the creation of Karaf distribution and Docker packaging.
